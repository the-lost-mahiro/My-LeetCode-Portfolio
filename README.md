## 💡 Warning
This repository serves as a record of my learning journey in Artificial Intelligence at VNU-UET. 

- **Self-Solved:** Problems solved entirely by my own logic and coding.
- **AI-Assisted (Labeled):** For complex challenges, I utilize AI (Gemini) to understand new algorithms. After grasping the concepts, I re-implement the code and debug it myself to ensure full understanding.

*Main goal: To gradually shift all "AI-Assisted" efforts into "Self-Solved" as my skills progress.*
