## 💡 About my portfolio
This repository serves as a record of my learning journey in Artificial Intelligence at VNU-UET. 

**Almost** all of the Hard or Medium-Hard problems above were solved with the help of AI (~almost 100%), so please read this carefully beforehand to avoid any misunderstanding about my skill level.

Also the index of the problem are different from LeetCode, so ignore it, focus on the question.
